## Why write new programming language, instead of writing a compiler for existing spec?

It is obvoius that writing for an existing spec would be easier in terms of programming,
testing and usability. But that limits the room for experimentation - there is not much
of creativity involved in implementing something that is already though about several times.
Also, there is just no language, that would appropriate for this project goal.

Different language suffer from different reasons - C has old spec that forces a lot of 
compiler algorithms that are inefective and not scalable - like preprocessor, order of definition etc.
C++ is bloated.
Java has complicated OOP.
Rust, GO and others 'C replacements' have too much friction - many of their features are extremly hard to implement
Older languages like Pascal seem like a good choice for writing concise grammar but lack features.
Python is too OOPy.
